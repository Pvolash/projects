Maybe I can start with keywords for this movie-sorry experience-. Human, emotions- the ones you thought didn't exixst within you-, real.
I definetly recommend this movie for many reasons but it helped me a lot.
For me it has a special meaning. This movie really helped me with connecting people. I am not 
sure but I think when I was little a was an asocial kid. Human interaction was really hard for me thus making it not that interesting.
But as I get older I starded being more and more confortable around people. I am bit off topic but recently I starded being more interested
in people. Around that time I watched this movie.
This movie gets really emotional. How it puts on light to the little details on friendship and human connection is what it feels like
to be art I think.
