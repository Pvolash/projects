"In an abandoned Tokyo overrun by bubbles and gravitational abnormalities, one gifted young man has a fateful meeting with a mysterious girl." is the official netflix movie discription but I think these words can not discribe how beatiful 
this movie is. This movie takes place in it's speacial Tokyo. One which is abondoned, one which has an anomally.
